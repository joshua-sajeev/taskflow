### Password Validation

[OWASP](https://owasp.org/) no longer recommends strict composition rules like:
“must contain 1 uppercase”
“must contain 1 lowercase”
“must contain 1 number”
“must contain 1 special character”
Why?

Because composition rules do NOT significantly improve security and they make passwords harder for users to remember!
