## Understanding `internal/domain/repository/`

The `internal/domain/repository/` package defines the repository layer for Taskflow, providing an abstraction for database operations related to jobs.

### 1. `job_repository.go`

Defines the `JobRepository` interface, which outlines methods for interacting with job records in the database. These methods include:
- `Create(job *entities.Job) error` - Inserts a new job.
- `FindByID(id uuid.UUID) (*entities.Job, error)` - Retrieves a job by its unique ID.
- `Update(job *entities.Job) error` - Updates an existing job.
- `Delete(id uuid.UUID) error` - Deletes a job by ID.

This interface provides a structured way to manage jobs, allowing for different implementations if needed.

### 2. `gorm_job_repository.go`

Implements the `JobRepository` interface using GORM as the ORM for database interactions. This file contains the `GormJobRepository` struct, which:
- Uses a `gorm.DB` instance for database connectivity.
- Implements CRUD operations (`Create`, `FindByID`, `Update`, `Delete`) using GORM methods.
- Ensures efficient data handling while abstracting database logic from the core application.

This package helps maintain clean separation between business logic and database operations, promoting flexibility and maintainability.
