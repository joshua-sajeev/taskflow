## Understanding `internal/jobqueue/`

The `internal/jobqueue/` package provides a job queuing system and worker pool for processing jobs asynchronously.

### 1. `job_queue.go`
- Implements the `JobQueue` struct, which:
  - Uses a buffered channel to manage job IDs.
  - Provides `Enqueue(jobID uuid.UUID)`, which adds jobs to the queue while handling overflow.
  - Provides `Dequeue() uuid.UUID`, which retrieves jobs from the queue.
  - Logs job processing events using Logrus.

### 2. `worker_pool.go`
- Implements the `WorkerPool` struct, which:
  - Manages a pool of workers that process jobs from the `JobQueue`.
  - Uses Goroutines to execute job logic concurrently.
  - Fetches job details from the database, executes the job, and updates its status.
  - Supports graceful shutdown by listening for a quit signal.

This package ensures efficient job processing and scalability in Taskflow's asynchronous execution system.
